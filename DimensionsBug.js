This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The dimensions might return `undefined` or incorrect values during the initial render or when the screen orientation changes. This can lead to layout issues, causing components to render improperly or be positioned incorrectly.

```javascript
import { Dimensions } from 'react-native';

const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

// ... use width and height ...
```
